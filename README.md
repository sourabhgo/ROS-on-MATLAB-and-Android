# ROS-on-MATLAB-and-Android

worked on the interfacing of ROS with MATLAB and Android. In MATLAB interfacing,
we used Robotics Toolbox and APIs to connect to ROS networks. Using these APIs, we
built a GUI application to teleoperate a ROS robot. In the Android-ROS interfacing section,
we set up and built Android-ROS applications from a Linux PC. After that, we
successfully built ROS-Android applications. We
also wrote the Android-ROS application code and its functions, and finally, built a custom Android-ROS application.
